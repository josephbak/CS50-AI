<ul>
<li>Increasing the number of convolutional layers and pooling layers increased the accuracy and decreased the loss. However, this in turn increased the model complexity and required more computing power.</li>
<li>Increasing the number of filters doesn't work as well as increasing the number of layers.</li>
<li>Increasing the dropout rate worked well, which shows there is some overfitting.</li>
